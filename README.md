## ratelimit hiring problem

The article describing this is here: https://billduncan.org/hiring-questions-problem-3/

The challenge was to create a rate limiting function which would reject
accept connection requests up to a limit of 5 per minute per ip address.
This is obviously just a proof-of-concept. A real function would need to
be written with a more performant language..
